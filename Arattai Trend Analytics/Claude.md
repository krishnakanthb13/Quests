I've created a detailed interactive analytics report on Arattai Messenger. Here are the key findings:

## üìä **Major Highlights**

### Explosive Growth (September 2025)
Arattai experienced an unprecedented surge in September 2025, with daily signups skyrocketing from approximately 3,000 to over 350,000 in just three days - a 100-fold increase. This rapid growth temporarily strained Zoho's infrastructure, requiring emergency scaling of servers and capacity.

### Current User Base
According to Jeri John, Global Product Head at Arattai, the platform has crossed 1 million monthly active users. Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu reported adding over 2 million new users in a single day during the peak growth period.

## üéØ **Key Features & Capabilities**

Arattai supports comprehensive messaging functionality including text and voice messages, multimedia sharing, and group chats accommodating up to 1,000 participants. The platform enables file sharing of up to 2 GB, matching WhatsApp's capabilities in this area.

**Unique Features:**
- Android TV support for conversations on larger displays
- Zoom-like video conferencing ("Meetings" function)
- Dedicated mentions tab similar to Slack
- Ad-free experience with no forced AI integration
- WhatsApp chat import functionality

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Security Gap**

Plain text messages in Arattai are not end-to-end encrypted, unlike other messaging platforms, though calls are encrypted. This has raised significant privacy concerns. However, Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu recently announced that Arattai is moving away from cloud storage to ensure user data stays only on the device, with end-to-end encryption for text messages promised.

## üèÜ **Competitive Position**

While Arattai reached #1 on Indian app stores, surpassing WhatsApp and Telegram during its viral period, it has achieved only 1 million+ monthly active users compared to WhatsApp's 535.8 million in India - representing approximately 0.18% of WhatsApp's Indian user base.

## üì∞ **Recent Newsworthy Events**

1. **October 2025**: Zoho announced integration of Zoho Pay, its payment gateway, into Arattai
2. **September 2025**: The viral surge was fueled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's push for adopting swadeshi (indigenous) tech and endorsements from government officials including Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan
3. **Privacy Promises**: Recent commitments to implement full end-to-end encryption following user concerns

## üåè **Market Context**

The growth reflects broader trends in India's messaging ecosystem driven by digital sovereignty movements and the government's Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) initiative. Arattai positions itself as a "Made-in-India" alternative with data hosted in Indian data centers, optimized for low-bandwidth connections and budget smartphones.

The interactive report above includes detailed charts, competitive analysis, and strategic recommendations for Arattai's continued growth trajectory.
