# Comprehensive Analytics Report on Arattai Messenger by Zoho

## Executive Summary
Arattai Messenger, developed by Zoho Corporation, is an Indian-made instant messaging app launched in 2021 as a privacy-focused alternative to global platforms. As of October 12, 2025, it has experienced explosive growth in India, driven by the government's Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) initiative and endorsements from key figures like Union Ministers. The app has surpassed 10 million downloads on Google Play, with monthly active users (MAUs) exceeding 1 million. However, it remains a niche player globally and faces challenges in scaling active usage against giants like WhatsApp. This report analyzes key metrics, features, updates, market presence, and competitive landscape, supported by data from industry reports, app stores, and news sources.

## User Growth Trends
Arattai has seen unprecedented growth in late September and early October 2025, transitioning from a low-profile app to a trending platform. Key trends include:

- **Sign-up Surge**: Daily sign-ups jumped from approximately 3,000 to 350,000 within three days in late September 2025, representing a 100-fold increase.
- **Download Growth**: Monthly downloads escalated from under 10,000 in August 2025 to 400,000 in September 2025. Total installs started October at around 2.6 million and reached over 10 million within the first week.
- **Traffic and Infrastructure Impact**: Overall traffic grew 100-fold in three days, straining servers and prompting rapid scaling.

The growth is visualized in the following chart, showing the dramatic increase in daily sign-ups over a short period:

| Metric | Pre-Surge (Aug 2025) | Peak Surge (Sep-Oct 2025) | Source |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| Daily Sign-ups | ~3,000 | 350,000 | Demandsage, Economic Times |
| Monthly Downloads | <10,000 | 400,000 | Demandsage |
| Total Installs | ~2.6M (Oct start) | >10M | Reddit, Forbes |

## Active User Statistics
While download numbers are impressive, active usage metrics indicate early-stage adoption:
- **Monthly Active Users (MAUs)**: Surpassed 1 million during the peak growth period in early October 2025.
- **Daily Active Users (DAUs)**: Not explicitly reported, but indirect indicators include over 100,000 daily meetings and 500,000 daily calls, with 20-30% daily growth. Active user base saw a 100X jump overall.
- **App Store Metrics**: On Google Play, 10M+ downloads with a 4.7 rating from 182K reviews. On Apple App Store, 4.9 rating from 89 reviews.

Compared to competitors, Arattai's active users are minuscule (e.g., WhatsApp has 448.9 million DAUs in India alone). Sensor Tower estimates vary, with some regions showing 3 million downloads in the last month, but no global DAU/MAU breakdown.

## Most Popular Features
Arattai emphasizes simplicity, privacy, and integration with Zoho's ecosystem. Popular features based on user reviews and official descriptions include:
- **Core Messaging**: One-to-one and group chats (up to 1,000 members), voice notes, text, and media sharing (photos, videos, documents).
- **Calls and Meetings**: Audio/video calls with end-to-end encryption (E2EE); dedicated "Meetings" tab for instant video conferencing.
- **Stories and Channels**: Sharing stories and broadcasting to large audiences.
- **Unique Additions**: "Pocket" for personal cloud storage/notes; multi-device support (up to 5 devices); import chats from WhatsApp; custom/animated stickers; location sharing; Mentions tab.
- **Privacy-Focused**: No ads, data stored in Indian servers; option to sell unused SMS (niche feature).
- **Platform Support**: Optimized for low-end devices/slow internet; available on Android TV, desktops, and mobiles.

User feedback highlights its lightweight design and speed, making it popular for basic communication without bloat.

## Recent Product Updates
Arattai has focused on scalability and privacy enhancements amid the surge:
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Currently available for calls; full E2EE for text messages is in development and expected soon (top priority).
- **Android TV Integration**: Official support added, unique among competitors like WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram.
- **Infrastructure Scaling**: Rapid server expansions to handle 100X traffic growth; planned major update in November 2025 for new features and capacity.
- **Chat Import**: Enhanced ability to import WhatsApp chats.
- **Last App Update**: Version 1.0.7 on iOS (date not specified); ongoing refinements based on user feedback.

No major updates post-October 3, but Zoho is addressing glitches like slow sync.

## Market Presence (India and Global)
- **India**: Dominant focus, with 7.5 million downloads by October 3, 2025, reaching over 10 million shortly after. Temporarily topped Google Play and Apple App Store charts, overtaking WhatsApp and Telegram. Appeals to regional users with Tamil roots and low-data optimization. Market share remains small (~1M MAUs vs. WhatsApp's 500M+ users).
- **Global**: Limited presence; primarily India-centric with negligible adoption elsewhere. Sensor Tower data shows minor downloads in regions like Singapore (3M last month estimate, but likely inflated or regional). No significant global rankings or stats reported.

## Competitive Positioning vs. WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram
Arattai positions itself as a "Made-in-India" alternative emphasizing privacy, low resource use, and sovereignty. However, it lags in scale and features:

| Aspect | Arattai | WhatsApp | Signal | Telegram | Notes |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| **DAUs (India)** | ~Est. 500K (inferred from calls/meetings) | 448.9M | 5.2M | 49.3M | Arattai minuscule. |
| **E2EE** | Calls yes; texts in progress | Full (default) | Full | Optional (secret chats) | Privacy concern for Arattai. |
| **Features** | Meetings tab, Pocket, Android TV, chat import | Channels, payments, business tools | Privacy focus, disappearing msgs | Large groups, bots, channels | Arattai lightweight; stands out with TV support. |
| **Market Strength** | India surge; small footprint | Ubiquitous; network effect | Privacy leader | Versatile, file sharing | Arattai challenges coordination game. |
| **Monetization** | Ad-free; no data selling | Meta ecosystem | Non-profit | Premium subs | Arattai ethical edge. |

Arattai's growth is promising but sustainability depends on E2EE rollout and network effects.
