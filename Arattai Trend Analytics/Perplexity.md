**1. User Growth Trends & Active User Statistics**
- **Explosive growth in October 2025:** Arattai surged from 2.6 million Google Play installs on October 1 to over 10.2 million by October 8, 2025—a nearly fourfold increase in just one week. The app also leads the social networking category in Apple’s App Store India rankings.[1][2][3][4]

**Arattai Messenger Google Play Store Installations (Oct 1–8, 2025)****2. Most Popular Features**
- **Messaging and Calling:** Texts, voice notes, audio/video calls, photos, document sharing, and ‘stories’.[7][8]
- **Lightweight App:** Optimized for low data usage and smooth performance on entry-level devices and areas with poor connectivity.[9]
- **Unique India-focused Features:** Built-in audio/video meetings, a “Mentions” tab, and strong location sharing.[10]
- **Security Features:** Voice/video call encryption; text message end-to-end encryption is coming soon for parity with WhatsApp.[11][12]
- **No Ads, No Data Tracking:** Zoho emphasizes strong privacy, a strict no-ads policy, and data residency in India (unlike foreign rivals).[13][12]

- **Upcoming Official Launch:** Zoho is preparing for a major rollout in November 2025, with more updates planned.[13]
- **AI Integration:** Plans to introduce AI features powered by Zoho’s Zia (auto-message flagging, smart replies) while ensuring privacy, as AI will run on Zoho’s private cloud only.[13]

- **Performance Upgrades:** Emergency scaling of infrastructure to support the explosive growth.[6]

**4. Market Presence (India & Global)**

- **App Store Rankings:** Arattai surpassed WhatsApp, Telegram, Snapchat, Messenger, and others on Indian app charts in October 2025.[14][9]

- **Legal and Policy Developments:** Even courts are acknowledging Arattai as a native alternative for official communications.[17]

**Summary**
Arattai Messenger has emerged, almost overnight in October 2025, as a formidable player in India’s messaging ecosystem—with 10+ million installations, viral government and influencer support, and a roadmap focused on privacy, “super app” features, and AI-powered experiences. As it closes the gap with global incumbents, its trajectory highlights the growing clout of India’s digital self-reliance movement and user appetite for indigenous, privacy-focused alternatives.[2][4][1][6][9][3][10]
