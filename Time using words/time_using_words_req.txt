Telling time in words involves saying the hour and minutes (e.g., "eight thirty"), using "o'clock" for exact hours ("ten o'clock"), and "quarter past/to" or "half past" for specific intervals, while using "minutes past/to" for other times (e.g., "five to three," "twenty past eleven"). You can say the hour first then minutes ("seven fifteen") or use past/to phrases for a more natural feel ("quarter past seven," "twenty-five to three").  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Basic formats 

• On the hour: "It's two o'clock" (2:00). [4, 5]  
• Minutes (01-30): Hour + Minutes (e.g., "six oh five" for 6:05) or Minutes + "past" + Hour (e.g., "five past six"). [2, 6]  
• Quarter past (15 mins): "Quarter past [Hour]" (e.g., "quarter past six" for 6:15). [2, 4]  
• Half past (30 mins): "Half past [Hour]" (e.g., "half past six" for 6:30). [2, 4]  

Minutes (31-59) 

• Minutes (31-59): Hour + Minutes (e.g., "six thirty-five" for 6:35) or Minutes + "to" + (Hour + 1) (e.g., "twenty-five to seven" for 6:35). [3, 6]  
• Quarter to (45 mins): "Quarter to [Next Hour]" (e.g., "quarter to seven" for 6:45). [4, 7]  

Examples 

• 10:00: Ten o'clock. 
• 3:15: Three fifteen, or a quarter past three. 
• 4:30: Four thirty, or half past four. 
• 8:40: Eight forty, or twenty to nine. 
• 9:50: Nine fifty, or ten to ten. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
